ESP8266-Sigofx-trackr is a ESP8266 / Arduino based WiFi tracking solution using Sigfox Atlas WiFi geoloction service.

This project uses an ESP8266 as main MCU and for WiFi scanning on regular basis. The 2 best Access Points MAC address are reported over Sigfox network using a Wisol WSSFM10R1 module.

This project is implementing Low Power feature on ESP8266 and Wisol module to reach a couple of uA most of the time. It includes different sub-library for managing:
 - ESP low power switch with context backup on RTC memory
 - ESP logging feature with flash storage and level filtering
 - Wisol module access library
